# Introduction
This paper proposes a deep learning-based network designed to automatically segment the supraspinatus tendon in MRI images of patients with supraspinatus tendon ruptures of the shoulder. We develop an innovative network that includes Spatial Context and Feature Refinement (SCFR) and Global-Spatial Enhancement Fusion (GSEF), which improve the model’s ability to capture the orientation of the tears.We also design a custom loss function tailored for small-region segmentation, which helps to mitigate false positives and address class imbalance.
